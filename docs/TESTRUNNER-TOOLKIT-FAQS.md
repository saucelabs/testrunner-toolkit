## How Does Testrunner Toolkit Work?
Native JavaScript testing is achieved through the combination of Sauce Labs, Jest, and the
JavaScript framework of your choice. In the current beta, the toolkit supports:
 
* [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)
* [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)
* [TestCafe](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe)
* [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress)

This approach gives you the power and expressiveness of different test frameworks with the dashboards, infrastructure, and analytics of [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/). 

The specific framework you want to use to for testing should be based on the types of tests you
need to run and the environment in which you are running them. In this beta you will be able to
run tests in your existing CI pipeline and benefit from the low latency. 

When tests are completed, logs, results, and videos will be uploaded to Sauce Labs to your account. After that, you can review, share, and analyze those results just as you would from any other test executed on Sauce Labs.

* Cypress, visit [https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress)

## Where are the Docker Images and Can I Inspect Them?

All images are hosted on Docker Hub. 

* [Base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/saucelabs/testrunner-image/tags)
is called `testrunner`. It contains the tooling necessary to record videos, VNC etc. Plus Chrome, and a Firefox version. 

* [Base image + Playwright](https://hub.docker.com/r/saucelabs/stt-playwright-jest-node/tags)
contains saucectl with different versions of Playwright.

* [Base image + Puppeteer](https://hub.docker.com/r/saucelabs/stt-puppeteer-jest-node/tags)
contains saucectl with different versions of Puppeteer.

* [Base image + TestCafe](https://hub.docker.com/r/saucelabs/stt-testcafe-node/tags)
contains saucectl with different versions of TestCafe.

* [Base image + Cypress](https://hub.docker.com/r/saucelabs/stt-cypress-mocha-node/tags) contains saucectl with different versions of Cypress.

## Are There any Test Code Samples? 
Yes! You can find them here: [Automation Framework Examples](testrunner-toolkit-test-preparation.md#automation-framework-examples).

## How Do I Use This in my Pipeline?
The GitHub repository includes CI/CD examples of `saucectl` using:
* [GitHub Actions Workflows](https://help.github.com/en/actions) 
* [CircleCI Pipelines](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/) 

Although the [GitHub Actions](./.github/workflows/tests.yml) and [CircleCI](./.circleci/config.yml) 
examples are included, the mechanism works with any CI/CD provider that supports containers.
